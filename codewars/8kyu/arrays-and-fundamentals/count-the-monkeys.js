/* CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to appreciate the full number. He has to start counting them from 1. As a good parent, you'll sit and count with him. 

Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number but excluding zero.

For example (input --> output):
10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
1 ---> [1]
*/

// MY SOLUTION
function monkeyCount(n) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result.push(i);
    }
    return result;
}

console.log(monkeyCount(10), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
console.log(monkeyCount(1), [1]);

// OTHER SOLUTIONS
const monkeyCount = n => Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i + 1);

const monkeyCount = n => [...Array(n)].map((_, i) => i + 1);

const monkeyCount = n => [...Array(n + 1).keys()].slice(1);

const monkeyCount = n => [...Array(n).keys()].map(i => i + 1);
